## Music globe ##

This is a visualization of **artists events locations** on a 3D globe.

Search for an artist or a band to see where they've been. Bar height and color are relative **per artist**: the more often a concert happened at a place, the higher the bar is.

Both past and upcoming events are displayed.

Artists suggestions are fetched from MusicBrainz and events from Bandsintown, so the artist choice could be limited. Bandsintown is also pretty recent (founded in 2007), "old artists" won't show up in the search.
