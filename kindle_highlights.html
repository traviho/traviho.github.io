Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it wont matter how successful you become or who is in your life— you wont enjoy any of it
</td></tr><tr><td>18-18</td><td>Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions, such as compassion and patience, are teachable skills; and the way we think directly influences our experience of the world.

</td></tr><tr><td>40-40</td><td>The fact that your mind is all you have and that it is possible to be at peace even in difficult circumstances can become an argument for ignoring obvious societal problems. But it is not a compelling one. The world is in desperate need of improvement— in global terms, freedom and prosperity remain the exception— and yet this doesn’t mean we need to be miserable while we work for the common good
</td></tr><tr><td>21-21</td><td>It seems to me that I spend much of my waking life in a neurotic trance. My experiences in meditation suggest, however, that an alternative exists. It is possible to stand free of the juggernaut of self, if only for moments at a time
</td></tr><tr><td>22-22</td><td>We seek pleasant sights, sounds, tastes, sensations, and moods. We satisfy our intellectual curiosity. We surround ourselves with friends and loved ones. We become connoisseurs of art, music, or food. But our pleasures are, by their very nature, fleeting. If we enjoy some great professional success, our feelings of accomplishment remain vivid and intoxicating for an hour, or perhaps a day, but then they subside. And the search goes on. The effort required to keep boredom and other unpleasantness at bay must continue, moment to moment.
</td></tr><tr><td>22-22</td><td>Ceaseless change is an unreliable basis for lasting fulfillment. Realizing this, many people begin to wonder whether a deeper source of well-being exists. Is there a form of happiness beyond the mere repetition of pleasure and avoidance of pain? Is there a happiness that does not depend upon having ones favorite foods available, or friends and loved ones within arms reach, or good books to read, or something to look forward to on the weekend? Is it possible to be happy before anything happens, before ones desires are gratified, in spite of lifes difficulties, in the very midst of physical pain, old age, disease, and death?
</td></tr><tr><td>23-23</td><td>If there exists a source of psychological well-being that does not depend upon merely gratifying ones desires, then it should be present even when all the usual sources of pleasure have been removed. Such happiness should be available to a person who has declined to marry her high school sweetheart, renounced her career and material possessions, and gone off to a cave or some other spot that is inhospitable to ordinary aspirations
</td></tr><tr><td>23-23</td><td>One clue to how daunting most people would find such a project is the fact that solitary confinement—which is essentially what we are talking about— is considered a punishment inside a maximum-security prison. Even when forced to live among murderers and rapists, most people still prefer the company of others to spending any significant amount of time alone in a room. And yet contemplatives in many traditions claim to experience extraordinary depths of psychological well-being while living in isolation for vast stretches of time. How should we interpret this? Either the contemplative literature is a catalogue of religious delusion, psychopathology, and deliberate fraud, or people have been having liberating insights under the name of “spirituality” and “mysticism” for millennia.
</td></tr><tr><td>24-24</td><td>what contemplatives throughout history have discovered is that there is an alternative to being continuously spellbound by the conversation we are having with ourselves; there is an alternative to simply identifying with the next thought that pops into consciousness. And glimpsing this alternative dispels the conventional illusion of the self
</td></tr><tr><td>24-24</td><td>Most traditions of spirituality also suggest a connection between self-transcendence and living ethically. Not all good feelings have an ethical valence, and pathological forms of ecstasy surely exist. I have no doubt, for instance, that many suicide bombers feel extraordinarily good just before they detonate themselves in a crowd. But there are also forms of mental pleasure that are intrinsically ethical. As I indicated earlier, for some states of consciousness, a phrase like “boundless love” does not seem overblown.

</td></tr><tr><td>25-25</td><td>The problem of finding happiness in this world arrives with our first breath— and our needs and desires seem to multiply by the hour.
</td></tr><tr><td>26-26</td><td>The burn of lifting weights, for instance, would be excruciating if it were a symptom of terminal illness. But because it is associated with health and fitness, most people find it enjoyable. Here we see that cognition and emotion are not separate. The way we think about experience can completely determine how we feel about it.
</td></tr><tr><td>26-26</td><td>And we always face tensions and trade-offs. In some moments we crave excitement and in others rest. We might love the taste of wine and chocolate, but rarely for breakfast. Whatever the context, our minds are perpetually moving—generally toward pleasure (or its imagined source) and away from pain.
</td></tr><tr><td>25-25</td><td>Seeking, finding, maintaining, and safeguarding our well-being is the great project to which we all are devoted, whether or not we choose to think in these terms.
</td></tr><tr><td>26-26</td><td>Our struggle to navigate the space of possible pains and pleasures produces most of human culture. Medical science attempts to prolong our health and to reduce the suffering associated with illness, aging, and death. All forms of media cater to our thirst for information and entertainment. Political and economic institutions seek to ensure our peaceful collaboration with one another—and the police or the military is summoned when they fail. Beyond ensuring our survival, civilization is a vast machine invented by the human mind to regulate its states. We are ever in the process of creating and repairing a world that our minds want to be in. And wherever we look, we see the evidence of our successes and our failures. Unfortunately, failure enjoys a natural advantage. Wrong answers to any problem outnumber right ones by a wide margin, and it seems that it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
</td></tr><tr><td>27-27</td><td>pleasures, however refined or easily acquired, are by their very nature fleeting. They begin to subside the instant they arise, only to be replaced by fresh desires or feelings of discomfort.
</td></tr><tr><td>27-27</td><td>We seem to do little more than lurch between wanting and not wanting. Thus, the question naturally arises: Is there more to life than this? Might it be possible to feel much better (in every sense of better) than one tends to feel? Is it possible to find lasting fulfillment despite the inevitability of change?
</td></tr><tr><td>40-40</td><td>The teachings of Buddhism, and of Eastern spirituality generally, focus on the primacy of the mind. There are dangers in this way of viewing the world, to be sure. Focusing on training the mind to the exclusion of all else can lead to political quietism and hive-like conformity. The fact that your mind is all you have and that it is possible to be at peace even in difficult circumstances can become an argument for ignoring obvious societal problems. But it is not a compelling one. The world is in desperate need of improvement— in global terms, freedom and prosperity remain the exception— and yet this doesn’t mean we need to be miserable while we work for the common good.
</td></tr><tr><td>40-40</td><td>One can, for instance, spend long periods of time in contemplative solitude for the purpose of becoming a better person in the world—having better relationships, being more honest and compassionate and, therefore,
</td></tr><tr><td>41-41</td><td>more helpful to ones fellow human beings. Being wisely selfish and being selfless can amount to very much the same thing.
</td></tr><tr><td>43-43</td><td>Nothing I say here is intended as a denial of the fact that psychological well-being requires a healthy ‘sense of self”—with all the capacities that this vague phrase implies. Children need to become autonomous, confident, and self-aware in order to form healthy relationships. And they must acquire a host of other cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal skills in the process of becoming sane and productive adults.
</td></tr><tr><td>44-44</td><td>It is always now. This might sound trite, but it is the truth. Its not quite true as a matter of neurology, because our minds are built upon layers of inputs whose timing we know must be different.11 But it is true as a matter of conscious experience. The reality of your life is always now. And to realize this, we will see, is liberating. In fact, I think there is nothing more important to understand if you want to be happy in this world. But we spend most of our lives forgetting this truth— overlooking it, fleeing it, repudiating it. And the horror is that we succeed. We manage to avoid being happy while struggling to become happy, fulfilling one desire after the next, banishing our fears, grasping at pleasure, recoiling from pain— and thinking, interminably, about how best to keep the whole works up and running. As a consequence, we spend our lives being far less content than we might otherwise be. We often fail to appreciate what we have until we have lost it. We crave experiences, objects, relationships, only to grow bored with them. And yet the craving persists.
</td></tr><tr><td>45-45</td><td>The quality of mind cultivated in vipassana is almost always referred to as “mindfulness,” and the literature on its psychological benefits is now substantial. There is nothing spooky about mindfulness. It is simply a state of clear, nonjudgmental, and undistracted attention to the contents of consciousness, whether pleasant or unpleasant. Cultivating this quality of mind has been shown to reduce pain, anxiety, and depression; improve cognitive function; and even produce changes in gray matter density in regions of the brain related to learning and memory, emotional regulation, and self-awareness.
</td></tr><tr><td>46-46</td><td>Being mindful is not a matter of thinking more clearly about experience; it is the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves. Mindfulness is a vivid awareness of whatever is appearing in one’s mind or body— thoughts, sensations, moods—without grasping at the pleasant or recoiling from the unpleasant.
</td></tr><tr><td>46-46</td><td>The principal enemy of mindfulness— or of any meditative
</td></tr><tr><td>47-47</td><td>practice— is our deeply conditioned habit of being distracted by thoughts. The problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without knowing that we are thinking. In fact, thoughts of all kinds can be perfectly good objects of mindfulness. In the early stages of ones practice, however, the arising of thought will be more or less synonymous with distraction— that is, with a failure to meditate.
</td></tr><tr><td>47-47</td><td>In the beginning of ones meditation practice, the difference between ordinary experience and what one comes to consider “mindfulness” is not very clear, and it takes some training to distinguish between being lost in thought and seeing thoughts for what they are. In this sense, learning to meditate is just like acquiring any other skill. It takes many thousands of repetitions to throw a good jab or to coax music from the strings of a guitar. With practice, mindfulness becomes a well-formed habit of attention, and the difference between it and ordinary thinking will become increasingly clear. Eventually, it begins to seem as if you are repeatedly awakening from a dream to find yourself safely in bed. No matter how terrible the dream, the relief is instantaneous. And yet it is difficult to stay awake for more than a few seconds at a time.
</td></tr><tr><td>47-47</td><td>likens this shift in awareness to the experience of being fully immersed in a film and then suddenly realizing that you are sitting in a theater watching a mere play of light on a wall. Your
</td></tr><tr><td>48-48</td><td>perception is unchanged, but the spell is broken. Most of us spend every waking moment lost in the movie of our lives. Until we see that an alternative to this enchantment exists, we are entirely at the mercy of appearances. Again, the difference I am describing is not a matter of achieving a new conceptual understanding or of adopting new beliefs about the nature of reality. The change comes when we experience the present moment prior to the arising of thought.
</td></tr><tr><td>48-48</td><td>A better translation would be “unsatisfactoriness.” Suffering may not be inherent in life, but unsatisfactoriness is. We crave lasting happiness in the midst of change: Our bodies age, cherished objects break, pleasures fade, relationships fail. Our attachment to the good things in life and our aversion to the bad amount to a denial of these realities, and this inevitably leads to feelings of dissatisfaction. Mindfulness is a technique for achieving equanimity amid the flux, allowing us to simply be aware of the quality of experience in each moment, whether pleasant or unpleasant. This may seem like a recipe for apathy, but it neednt be. It is actually possible to be mindful— and, therefore, to be at peace with the present moment— even while working to change the world for the better.

If the historical Buddha were “omniscient,” he would have been, at minimum, a better mathematician, physicist, biologist, and Jeopardy contestant than any person who has ever lived. Is it reasonable to expect that an ascetic in the fifth century BC, by virtue of his meditative insights, spontaneously became an unprecedented genius in every field of human inquiry, including those that did not exist at the time in which he lived?
</td></tr><tr><td>53-53</td><td>I make no claims in support of magic or miracles in this book. However, I can say that the true goal of meditation is more profound than most people realize— and it does, in fact, encompass many of the experiences that traditional mystics claim for themselves. It is quite possible to lose ones sense of being a separate self and to experience a kind of boundless, open awareness— to feel, in other words, at one with the cosmos. This says a lot about the possibilities of human consciousness, but it says nothing about
</td></tr><tr><td>54-54</td><td>the universe at large. And it sheds no light at all on the relationship between mind and matter. The fact that it is possible to love one s neighbor as oneself should be a great finding for the field of psychology, but it lends absolutely no credence to the claim that Jesus was the son of God, or even that God exists. Nor does it suggest that the “energy” of love somehow pervades the cosmos. These are historical and metaphysical claims that personal experience cannot justify.
</td></tr><tr><td>54-54</td><td>However, a phenomenon like self-transcending love does entide us to make claims about the human mind. And this particular experience is so well attested and so readily achieved by those who devote themselves to specific practices (the Buddhist technique of metta meditation, for instance) or who even take the right drug (MDMA) that there is very little controversy that it exists. Facts of this kind must now be understood in a rational context.
</td></tr><tr><td>54-54</td><td>The traditional goal of meditation is to arrive at a state of wellbeing that is imperturbable— or if perturbed, easily regained. The French monk Matthieu Ricard describes such happiness as “a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind.”15 The purpose of meditation is to recognize that you already have such a mind. That discovery, in turn, helps you to cease doing the things that produce needless confusion and suffering for yourself and others. O f course, most people never truly master the practice and dont reach a condition of imperturbable happiness. The near goal, therefore, is to have an increasingly healthy mind— that is, to be moving ones mind in the right direction
</td></tr><tr><td>55-55</td><td>The question of whether enlightenment is a permanent state need not detain us. The crucial point is that you can glimpse something about the nature of consciousness that will liberate you from suffering in the present. Even just recognizing the impermanence of your mental states— deeply, not merely as an idea—can transform your life. Every mental state you have ever had has arisen and then passed away.
</td></tr><tr><td>56-56</td><td>I have never met another person who denied that some of us are stronger, more athletic, or more learned than others. But many people find it difficult to acknowledge that a continuum of moral and spiritual wisdom exists or that there might be better and worse ways to traverse it.
</td></tr><tr><td>57-57</td><td>We must learn to use language before we can work with it creatively or understand its limits, and the conventional self must form before we can investigate it and understand that it is not what it appears to be
</td></tr><tr><td>57-57</td><td>But it is your mind, rather than circumstances themselves, that determines the quality of your life. Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it.
</td></tr><tr><td>59-59</td><td>the associated pleasures, raping and pillaging cant be a stable strategy for finding happiness in this world. Given our social requirements, we know that the deepest and most durable forms of well-being must be compatible with an ethical concern for other people— even for complete strangers— otherwise, violent conflict becomes inevitable. We also know that there are certain forms of happiness that are not available to a person even if, like Genghis Khan, he finds himself on the winning side of every siege. Some pleasures are intrinsically ethical— feelings like love, gratitude, devotion, and compassion. To inhabit these states of mind is, by definition, to be brought into alignment with others.
</td></tr><tr><td>58-58</td><td>No doubt certain people can derive mental pleasure— and even experience genuine ecstasy—by behaving in ways that produce immense suffering for others. But we know that these states are anomalous— or, at least, not sustainable— because we depend upon one another for more or less everything. Whatever

But most of this mental work occurs entirely in the dark, and it is a mystery why any part of the process should be attended by consciousness
</td></tr><tr><td>67-67</td><td>I am sympathetic with those who, like the philosopher Colin McGinn and the psychologist Steven Pinker, have suggested that perhaps the emergence of consciousness is simply incomprehensible in human terms.17 Every chain of explanation must end somewhere— generally with a brute fact that neglects to explain itself. Perhaps consciousness presents an impasse of this sort.
</td></tr><tr><td>68-68</td><td>Fluidity really is “nothing but” the free motion of molecules. For this explanation to be sufficient, we must admit that molecules exist, of course, but once we do, the problem is solved. No one has described a set of unconscious events whose sufficiency as a cause of consciousness would make sense in this way
</td></tr><tr><td>69-69</td><td>Much work in biology remains to be done, but anyone who entertains vitalism*at this point is simply ignorant about the nature of living systems
</td></tr><tr><td>70-70</td><td>Again, there is nothing about a brain, studied at any scale, that even suggests that it might harbor consciousness— apart from the fact that we experience consciousness direcdy and have correlated many of its contents, or lack thereof, with processes in our brains
</td></tr><tr><td>70-70</td><td>Consider, for instance, our experience of seeing an object: Its color, contours, apparent motion, and location in space arise in consciousness as a seamless unity, even though this information is processed by many separate systems in the brain. Thus, when a golfer prepares to hit a shot, he does not first see the balls roundness, then its whiteness, and only then its position on the tee. Rather, he enjoys a unified perception of the ball. Many neuroscientists believe that this phenomenon of “binding” can be explained by disparate groups of neurons firing in synchrony.24 Whether or not this theory is true, it is at least intelligible— because synchronous activity seems just the sort of thing that could explain the unity of a percept. This work suggests, as many other findings in neuroscience do, that the contents of consciousness can often be made sense of in terms of their underlying neurophysiology.25 However, when we ask why such phenomena should be experienced in the first place, we are returned to the mystery of consciousness in full

But when I looked up information for the district attorney, I realized that he was up for reelection later that year. I immediately started replying to the Tweets and messages of frustration that I was seeing: “THIS PERSON IS RUNNING FOR REELECTION—GIVE YOUR MONEY TO HIS CHALLENGER. MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM.” Because I already knew that if moral arguments and outrage were going to persuade a district attorney to press charges against an officer for shooting an unarmed black person, we would have seen more than only eighteen officers charged with unlawful death in 2015, in over 1,100 killings of civilians by police that year. But everyone responds to threats to their livelihood.

And later, the function of racism was somewhat repurposed as a way of dividing lower classes, still with the ultimate goal of the economic and political supremacy of white elites.
</td></tr><tr><td>16-16</td><td>Even the election of our first black president did not lessen the lure of this promise to draw people to their support of racism. If anything, the election strengthened it. His election was a clear, undeniable sign that some black people could get more, and then what about everyone else’s share? Those who had always blatantly or subconsciously depended on that promise, that they would get more because others would get less, were threatened in ways that they could not put words to. But suddenly, this didn’t feel like “their country” anymore. Suddenly, they didn’t feel like “their needs” were being met.
</td></tr><tr><td>28-28</td><td>Getting my neighbor to love people of color might make it easier to hang around him, but it won’t do anything to combat police brutality, racial income inequality, food deserts, or the prison industrial complex. Further, this approach puts the onus on me, the person being discriminated against, to prove my humanity and worthiness of equality to those who think I’m less than. But so much of what we think and feel about people of other races is dictated by our system, and not our hearts. Who we see as successful, who has access to that success, who we see as scary, what traits we value in society, who we see as “smart” and “beautiful”—these perceptions are determined by our proximity to the cultural values of the majority in power, the economic system of those in power, the education system of those in power, the media outlets of those in power—I could go on, but at no point will you find me laying blame at the feet of one misguided or even hateful white person, saying, “and this is Steve’s fault— core beliefs about black people are all determined by Steve over there who just decided he hates black people all on his own.” Steve is interacting with the system in the way in which it’s designed, and the end result is racial bigotry that supports the continued oppression of people of color
</td></tr><tr><td>29-29</td><td>So a good question to ask yourself right now is: why are you here? Did you pick up this book with the ultimate goal of getting people to be nicer to each other? Did you pick up this book with the goal of making more friends of different races? Or did you pick up this book with the goal of helping fight a system of oppression that is literally killing people of color? Because if you insist on holding to a definition of racism that reduces itself to “any time somebody is mean to somebody of a different race” then this is not the book to accomplish your goals. And those are real and noble goals when we call them what they are—we really should be more kind to each other. But when I look at what is putting me and millions of other people of color at risk, a lack of niceness from white people toward me and people who look like me is very far down the list of priorities

How do you fix an economic system that values the work done traditionally by white males over that done by women and people of color on an emotional basis? How do you change an education system tailored almost exclusively to the experiences, history, and goals of white families on an emotional basis? How do you address an overwhelmingly white system of government on an emotional basis? We can get every person in America to feel nothing but love for people of color in their hearts, and if our systems aren’t acknowledged and changed, it will bring negligible benefit to the lives of people of color.

</td></tr><tr><td>27-27</td><td>The first night, in fact, I didn’t get any rest at all, just tossed and turned and threw up. My legs ached terribly and I banged them against the bed in a vain effort to knock the pain out. This common response is probably why they call heroin withdrawal “kicking.” When I ran to the bathroom, I couldn’t bear seeing my hugely dilated pupils in the mirror over the sink. Their gaping vacancy reminded me that my eyes were now in the opposite state of the blissfully tiny pinpoint pupils that you exhibit while high on opioids. Everything was painful and loud and bright and discomfiting. And the temperature was never right. I was either freezing or sweating profusely.
</td></tr><tr><td>27-27</td><td>I had three emotional states in detox: depression, euphoria, and boredom. I swung rapidly between them. One moment, I’d be manic and grandiose: it was all going to work out and I would soon be back on my rightful path to fame, fortune, and greatness! The next, I’d be crushed by physical discomfort and plunged into utter despair about my legal situation: 15 years in prison, mandatory minimum, no parole, no chance at a better life. Then, I’d be overcome with desire to start some great project, anything to distract me from the dullness of where I was, although I couldn’t conceive of what it should be or muster enough energy even to try to do so
</td></tr><tr><td>27-27</td><td>I was still losing weight at this point; I went from 85 pounds down to 80 in my seven days in the hospital. I lay in the warm water, often twitching with nervous discomfort
</td></tr><tr><td>28-28</td><td>the physical symptoms aren’t the main problem. What makes drug withdrawal hard to take is the anxiety, the insomnia, and the sense of losing the only thing you have that makes life bearable and worth living, not the puking and the shaking. It’s the mental and emotional symptoms—the learned connection between drugs and relief and between lack of drugs and pain—that matter. In fact, it’s this type of existential terror and anxiety that actually gives the most excruciating flourish to any bad experience: the meaning of pain profoundly affects how it is felt, and the more worry and fear involved, the worse the suffering. Pain that is viewed as life threatening literally feels more intense and agonizing than pain with a known, nondangerous origin or time frame; studies find that people who believe a particular type of pain means that worse is to come actually rate it as more severe on pain scales than they do if they have the exact same physical experience but can be reassured that it’s nothing to fear. Gavril Pasternak, a pain specialist at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, once described a classic case of this phenomenon to me. A patient he’d treated for breast cancer pain returned years later with an aching back. She thought that her back pain meant that the cancer had returned and would soon kill her. She wanted opioids. But, in fact, there had been no recurrence. After testing ruled out cancer and Pasternak told her that she had garden variety disc pain, her relief was immediate. She no longer felt the pain to be unbearable and didn’t want any kind of drugs. It was her analysis of what the pain meant that had tormented her. The psychology and the experience of pain are inseparable. Moreover, no matter whether the source of pain is obviously “physical” or “just psychological,” the unpleasant aspect of the experience is processed by many of the same parts of the brain. Not coincidentally, these regions are rich in opioid receptors. Without heroin, my receptors were screaming for relief, the addiction having reduced or otherwise disabled my natural supply of endorphins and enkephalins, which are the brain’s heroin-like neurotransmitters. Mostly, I felt utterly stripped of safety and love. And so, what tormented me most as I shook through August of 1988 wasn’t the nausea and chills but the recurring fear that I’d never have lasting comfort or joy again
</td></tr><tr><td>29-29</td><td>if addiction is simply needing something to function, we are all food, water, and air addicts and the term is pretty well meaningless
</td></tr><tr><td>31-31</td><td>In addiction, adolescence is the high-risk period because this is when the brain changes to prepare for adult sexuality and responsibilities and when people begin to develop ways of coping that will serve them for the rest of their lives. For example, the odds of alcoholism for those who start drinking at age 14 or younger are nearly 50%—but they drop to 9% for those who start at age 21 or later. And the risk of rapidly developing addiction to marijuana, cocaine, opioids, and pills like Valium is two to four times greater for those who start using at age 11–17, compared to those who start at 18 or later. If you manage to make it through adolescence and young adulthood without developing an addictive coping style, your odds of developing one later, while not nonexistent, are dramatically reduced
</td></tr><tr><td>31-31</td><td>Addiction, then, is a coping style that becomes maladaptive when the behavior persists despite ongoing negative consequences. This persistence occurs because “overlearning” or reduced brain plasticity makes the behavior extremely resistant to change. Plasticity is the brain’s ability to learn or change with experience. Lowered plasticity means this ability is compromised, and when a pattern of activity is locked in, it is “overlearned.” The capacity for such overlearning is a feature of the brain’s motivational systems, which evolved to promote survival and reproduction. The strong drives that these systems create can be useful when they spur persistence in love, work, and parenting. However, their intense resistance to change becomes a “bug” in our programming when drug taking or other unhealthy activities continue in the face of ongoing harm.

It alters the way the brain decides what it values—for example

</td></tr><tr><td>32-32</td><td>THERE IS A Polaroid picture of me taken the day I entered rehab, on August 11, 1988. My pupils are so large from withdrawal that my blue eyes look black, and because I’m so thin, they are deeply sunken into my face. I have dark roots showing under my bleached blond hair and it is still scraggly and patchy from the hair pulling I’d done while using coke. My nose looks like I’d taken a punch—I’m not sure why, but it is swollen well beyond its normal size, even though I’d shot all my drugs rather than snorted them for years by that point. I’m smiling but I look utterly vacant and tentative. I’m so frail that I look old; except for the smoothness of my face, you’d never guess I was in my 20s. The muscles in my neck and my collarbone stick out, and on the back of the hand that’s draped on the counter, you can make out the red lines of my tracks if you look closely. Indeed, 26 years later, I still have faint scars there.
</td></tr><tr><td>33-33</td><td>That drive to return to the past isn’t an innocent one. It’s about stopping your passage to the future, it’s a symptom of fear of death, and the love of predictable experience. And the love of predictable experience, not the drug itself, is the major damage done to users.
